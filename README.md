## Creating the Default Admin User

To initialize the application with a default admin user who has full administrative rights, run:

```bash
flask create-admin
flask seed-roles
```

This command will:

- Create the 'admin' role if it does not exist.
- Create the admin user with username, email, and password as defined in your environment variables.
- Assign the 'admin' role to this user.

If the admin user already exists, it will notify you accordingly.

### Example Output

```
üõ†Ô∏è Created 'admin' role.

```

Or if user exists:

```
‚ÑπÔ∏è Admin user already exists.
```
